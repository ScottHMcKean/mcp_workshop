# Hour 1, Part B — Production Patterns on Databricks (Appendix)

> Goal: by the end of this section, you can sketch an MCP architecture on a whiteboard and defend every box.
>
> **Note:** this workshop runs entirely inside Databricks Free Edition (Genie Code, AI Playground, a notebook, a Databricks App). The patterns below are what you'd reach for when productionizing for your team — covered conceptually here, not all built in the hands-on portion.

## The reference architecture

```

Three things to note:

1. **Servers do not talk to each other.** The host fans out and reconciles.
2. **Managed MCPs are zero-config** — they appear in *Agents → MCP Servers* the moment you log in.
3. **Only `bakehouse-detective` is something you operate** (Section E). The rest you consume.

## Pattern 1 — The MCP gateway

When you have many MCP servers, do not give the host N URLs. Run one **gateway** server that aggregates them. Reasons:

- Single auth surface.
- Single quota / rate-limit point.
- A `tools/list` denylist for "we don't want users to see *that* tool from the upstream."
- Tool name namespacing (`internal.consumption.query` vs `web.search`).
- Observability: every call passes through one place.

Databricks Apps is a great gateway — a FastMCP server proxies to upstream servers and writes audit rows to UC.

## Pattern 2 — Identity passthrough

The single most important governance decision: **does the MCP server act as the user, or as itself?**

| Mode                  | Pros                              | Cons                                                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Service principal     | Easy, one identity to provision   | Lose per-user attribution; UC ACLs become "the SP can do everything" |
| **Identity passthrough** | UC RLS/CLS just works; real audit | Must forward tokens correctly; tokens expire        |

In a Databricks App with `user_authorization.scopes` declared in `app.yaml` and the user consented, the user's OAuth token is forwarded as `X-Forwarded-Access-Token`. Use it for full identity passthrough.

> **Free Edition caveat (April 2026):** the platform forwards `x-forwarded-email`, `x-forwarded-user`, and `x-forwarded-preferred-username` but **not** the access token. Apps on Free Edition can attribute audit rows to the calling user but cannot execute as them. In paid workspaces the token forwarding works as documented. The workshop's `app/main.py` handles both modes — its step 0 SSE event tells you which is active.

## Pattern 3 — Tools that *are* UC functions

A Unity Catalog Python function is callable from Genie, the SQL editor, and an MCP server with no glue code.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION main.workshop.franchise_health(
  franchise_id STRING
) RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE PYTHON AS $$ ... $$;
```

The Databricks UC Functions MCP server exposes every UC function in a schema as a tool, with permissions enforced by UC. This is the cheapest way to ship a governed tool — you don't write any MCP code.

**Rule of thumb**: if the tool is "read or compute over Delta", make it a UC function. Reach for FastMCP only when you need sampling, elicitation, resources, or non-Delta side effects.

## Pattern 4 — Genie as a tool

A Genie Space is callable as an MCP tool through the managed Genie MCP server. Don't reimplement text-to-SQL — let Genie own that, and have your custom server orchestrate around it.

```
custom MCP tool: compose_brief(franchise)
  ├─ calls ask_genie:    "Austin sales trend last 90 days"
  ├─ calls query_vs_index: "Austin reviews mentioning waiting"
  ├─ calls you.com:      "Austin food-and-bev competition 2026"
  ├─ ctx.session.create_message(...)   <- sampling
  └─ writes a Delta row to a `findings` table
```

This is the layering people miss. **Genie is not the agent — Genie is one of the agent's tools.** Same for Vector Search.

## Pattern 5 — Resources for "give me the catalog"

Browsing 5,000 franchises as a tool argument autocomplete is bad UX. Expose them as **resources**:

```
franchise://list                 <- index resource
franchise://austin/profile        <- per-franchise markdown
franchise://austin/recent_signals <- per-franchise live data (subscribable, drives notifications)
```

The host can render these as a picker. The user attaches one to context. The model never sees the full list.

## Pattern 6 — Governance as Delta tables

Don't outsource your audit log. Write it.

```sql
CREATE TABLE main.observability.mcp_calls (
  call_id STRING, ts TIMESTAMP, user_email STRING,
  server STRING, tool STRING, args STRING, latency_ms BIGINT,
  status STRING, error STRING
) USING DELTA;

CREATE TABLE main.observability.mcp_lineage (
  call_id STRING, ts TIMESTAMP, user_email STRING,
  produced_table STRING, produced_uri STRING,
  source_tools ARRAY<STRING>
) USING DELTA;
```

Every tool call writes to `mcp_calls`. Every tool that produces a Delta row writes to `mcp_lineage`. You get a real audit trail, a self-service usage dashboard via AI/BI, and a lineage graph that joins to UC system tables.

## Anti-patterns to call out

- **One mega-tool with a `mode` parameter.** Split it. The model picks better with narrow tools.
- **Tool descriptions that re-explain JSON-Schema.** The host already shows the schema. Use the description to say *when to use this tool*.
- **Servers that wrap the OpenAI SDK.** If you find yourself shipping an API key inside an MCP server, you wanted **sampling**.
- **stdio in production.** stdio is for the host's child processes. A Databricks App should not be stdio.
- **Auth via shared bearer in env var.** This is a hack for demos. Use the App's OAuth integration.

## Recap

- Run a gateway. Pass identity through. Govern in UC.
- Reach for UC functions first, FastMCP second.
- Layer Genie and Vector Search as tools, not as agents.
- Audit and lineage are Delta tables, not log files.
